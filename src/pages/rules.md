- Intentionally damaging or altering another player's build without permission.
- Placing blocks or entities to cause lag or disrupt gameplay.
- Trapping players against their will.

#### **4.2 Protected and Unprotected Areas**

- Always respect protected areas and builds, regardless of their location.
- In unprotected areas, assume all structures belong to someone unless explicitly stated otherwise.

  - **Old Spawn (world 0,0)**: This region is protected and cannot be altered as a piece of server history.
  - **End Island (world\_the\_end 0,0)**: Can be altered but not claimed, and no machines can be built unless stated otherwise.

#### **4.3 Definition of a Building/Property**

A "building" or "property" is defined as a **purposeful creation by a player**, which meets the following criteria:

##### **4.3.1 Intent and Purpose**

- A structure or arrangement of blocks showing clear intent for **functional** (e.g., farms, storage, infrastructure) or **decorative** (e.g., houses, statues, landscaping) purposes.
- Must be visibly distinguishable from random block placements or temporary setups (e.g., scaffolding, accidental drops).

##### **4.3.2 Minimum Size and Activity**

  - **Activity Requirement**: Contains items indicating use or intent, such as:
    - Crafting tables, furnaces, chests, beds.

  - **Borders** or fencing to outline the property.

  - A structure left untouched or unused for a period of **14 days** without clear signs of ongoing work may be considered abandoned.

  - The original builder explicitly gives permission.
  - The structure is abandoned under the server’s defined timeframe.

- Scamming, or intentionally deceiving other players for personal gain, is prohibited.
