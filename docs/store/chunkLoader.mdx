# Chunk Loader

:::info Overview
The **Chunk Loader** is a specialized block that keeps an area continuously active, simulating the presence of a player. When placed, it maintains a 7x7 chunk zone (centered on the loader with a 3-chunk radius on each side), enabling farming, redstone, and mob spawning to function even in a playerâ€™s absence.
