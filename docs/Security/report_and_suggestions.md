# 📢 Feedback and Bug Reporting

Welcome to the feedback and bug reporting system! This system is designed to help you report bugs and suggest ideas for the project. 
This will help us improve the project and make it better for everyone. This section is in discord.


## Available Commands (for discord)
There are two main commands:
- `/bug` - Use this in the #bug channel
- `/idea` - Use this in the #suggestions channel

## Command Format
`/<Command> <title> <attachments>`
Example: `/bug Item Duplication Glitch [screenshot.png]`

## After Creating a Report
- A thread will be created for discussion
- Users can react with emojis to upvote the report

## Suggestions
Suggestions need a minimum of 5 upvotes to be considered for development (create a card for devs).

## Karma System
You can earn Karma for your contributions:
- 1 Karma for each upvote on your ideas
- 10 Karma when your `/bug` report is marked as completed
- 20 Karma when your `/idea` is marked as completed

*The future benefits of Karma will be announced later. Stay tuned!*

## Tips
- Be clear and concise in your bug reports and ideas
- Use appropriate channels for each command
- Engage in discussions to refine ideas and help solve bugs
- Upvote 👍 valuable contributions from others
