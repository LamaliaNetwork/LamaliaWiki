## Land Taxes & Upkeep

:::info
Taxes and upkeep are collected daily at midnight.
:::

### Tax
The amount depends on the land owner.

### Upkeep
If you are the owner of the land, you will pay $3 for each chunk you claim.

:::note Upkeep Calculation
(3 x Chunk) x upkeep boost
:::

:::caution
Remember, as your land level increases, so does your upkeep percentage. Make sure to balance your land's growth with your ability to maintain it!
