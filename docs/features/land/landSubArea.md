# Land Sub Area

## What is a Area?
Land areas are "sub areas/lands" inside a land. These areas are three dimensional, that means that they are not bound to chunks but instead to blocks. You can trust players to specific area(s) and set flags for them, similar to how you would manage the main land.

## How to Create Sub Area

### 1. Create Area 
   
   - type `/l menu areas`
   - click Create Area.
   - Enter the Area Name in chat. [type cancel to abort.]

### 2. Define Sub Area 
   - type `/l selection`
   - left/rigth click or key `Q` to set corner of the Area. [Change tool slot to cancel.] 
   - type `/l assign [Area Name]` to assign selection to sub Area.
