## Tips for Safe Mirror Usage
1. **Plan your build:** Before activating the mirror, plan out your build to avoid unintended consequences.
2. **Clear the area:** Ensure the mirrored area is clear of important structures.
3. **Start small:** Begin with small builds to get a feel for how the mirror works.
4. **Regular saves:** If possible, make backups or use the mirror in areas that can be easily restored.


:::note
The Mirror feature is a powerful tool that can significantly speed up symmetrical builds. However, it requires careful use to avoid unintended destruction.
